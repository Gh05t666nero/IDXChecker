# What is IDXChecker?
IDXChecker is an account checker for the popular cryptocurrency service Indodax written in Python. IDXChecker managed to circumvent Indodax's security system which prevented massive account checks. The Indodax security system is in the form of a sliding Captcha, but this security system is not very safe for an Indodax company. IDXChecker was created wholeheartedly with the intention of educating that it should not be used to commit any crime that would be committed under the responsibility of program users not the same creators.
